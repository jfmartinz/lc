# Notes

## Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that contains elements in an ordered sequence. It is an abstract data type, pretty similar to a stack.

But unlike stacks, we can perform operations at both ends of a queue.

We insert data at one end of the queue and remove data from the other end.

Think of a queue at the cinema theatre counter. The person standing first in the queue gets the ticket and leaves the group, while a new person joins at the back end of the queue.

This is at the center of the working of a queue, known as the First In First Out principle.

Operations:<br>
**Enqueue():** This is the process of adding or storing an element to the rear end(back-end) of a queue.<br>
**Dequeue():** It refers to removing or accessing an element from the front-end of a queue.<br>
**peek():** This function brings the asked element to the front-end of the queue without removing it.<br>
**isEmpty():** It checks if the queue is empty.<br>
**isFull():** It checks if the queue is full.
